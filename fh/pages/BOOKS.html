            <p class="text1">Only forty thousand people made it when the Last War devastated the world. They found their refuge in the tunnels of the Metro – the subway system of Moscow.
            Two decades after the nuclear Apocalypse, the survivors are still locked underground as the surface of the planet is poisoned by nuclear fallout and swarming with mutant monsters. There, in the catacombs of the Metro, they have created a new civilization.
            Now a new terror arises, and mankind’s last home is threatened. Its fate lies in the hands of one young man...Artyom.

            <p class="text2">A pandemic of an unknown disease is sweeping through the Metro. In a world without medicine, and in a society where shamanism is growing, there’s little that can be done to contain the deadly virus.
            The residents of the Metro have been ordered they must save who they can– and destroy anyone who poses a risk.
            But one girl, born in a distant corner of the tunnels, is prepared to disobey. A girl called Sasha…
